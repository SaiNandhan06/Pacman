# Pacman

Arcade-style Pacman remake rendered on an HTML5 canvas. The maze, pellets, Pacman sprite sheet, and four ghosts are all driven by vanilla JavaScript with simple BFS-style pathfinding to make the ghosts chase you when in range.

## Highlights
- Responsive canvas rendering with custom wall, pellet, score, and life drawing routines.
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys or WASD) with smooth direction changes and sprite animations.
- Ghost AI that alternates between random roaming targets and chasing Pacman when close, plus simple collision detection and life tracking.

## Run It Locally
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no build step required).
3. Use the arrow keys or WASD to survive as long as you can.

Enjoy the nostalgia!
